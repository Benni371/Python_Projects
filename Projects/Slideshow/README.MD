# Brief Introduction #  
This was a project that I undertook trying to see if I could integrate and old Ipad 1 screen with my rasberry pi.

## Process ##
My work was getting rid of some old ipads that had become obsolete in our work environment. I decided to take one apart and salvage its lcd screen. I watched a couple youtube videos on how to find its LCD Control Board equivalent and ordered it from Ebay. Once it arrived, I unpacked it and hooked it up to my rasberry pi. Unfortunately the settings were in chinese. So after fiddling with google translate I got the config to be in english. I then hooked it up to my rasberry pi and then followed a tutorial on how to make a slideshow

## Setup ##
All you need to do for the setup is clone the repo then create an images folder that you will reference in the main.py file
